Yes, based on the details you've provided, this is a smart choice. The blend door actuators (and often the doors themselves) in the 2005 Dodge RAM 1500 are a common failure point, and accessing them requires removing the dashboard, dropping the steering column, and partially disassembling the HVAC housing. Since you're already going that deep and suspecting A/C issues (like reduced cooling, which could stem from a failing evaporator, compressor, or leaks), it's efficient to replace all major HVAC components at once. This prevents repeated labor-intensive teardowns in the future, as these systems are interconnected and prone to cascading failures in older trucks like yours (e.g., plastic doors warping or breaking under actuator stress, leading to poor temperature control or airflow). Many owners report that partial fixes lead to recurring problems within 12-18 months, so a full rebuild is preventive and cost-effective long-term.

Below is a comprehensive parts list for a full HVAC rebuild on your 2005 Dodge RAM 1500 SLT with the 4.7L Magnum V8. This assumes a dual-zone climate control system (common in SLT trims; if yours is single-zone, you can skip the passenger-side blend door actuator and door kit). The list is categorized for clarity and includes everything needed for actuators/doors, cores, A/C system refresh, electrical components, seals/consumables, and miscellaneous items to complete the job yourself. I've focused on OEM-equivalent or upgraded parts where possible (e.g., metal door kits over plastic for durability). Quantities are based on typical requirements for this model.

Quantities, part examples, and recommendations draw from common repair guides and parts catalogs for 2002-2008 RAM trucks, as the HVAC design is consistent across these years.

### 1. Actuators and Blend/Mode Doors
These are the core of your issue. The 2005 RAM 1500 typically has up to 5 actuators in dual-zone setups: recirculation, left/right blend (temperature control), and two mode (airflow direction). The plastic doors often fail, so opt for metal replacement kits like HeaterTreater for longevity.

- Blend Door Actuator (Driver/Left Side, Main): 1 unit (e.g., Dorman 604-002 or Mopar 5019631AA). Controls temperature on the driver's side.
- Blend Door Actuator (Passenger/Right Side): 1 unit (e.g., Dorman 604-017 or Mopar 4885206AB). For dual-zone only; controls passenger temperature.
- Mode Door Actuator (Main/Defrost): 1 unit (e.g., Dorman 604-005 or Mopar equivalent). Controls vent/defrost/floor airflow.
- Mode Door Actuator (Secondary): 1 unit (e.g., Dorman similar to above). For additional mode control in the housing.
- Recirculation Door Actuator: 1 unit (e.g., Dorman 604-038 or Mopar 4885206AA). Controls fresh vs. recirculated air.
- Blend/Mode Door Repair Kit (Metal Upgrade): 1 full kit (e.g., HeaterTreater complete set for RAM 02-08, which includes steel replacements for recirculation door, upper/lower blend doors, Mode 1 door, and Mode 2 door; or individual Dorman kits like 902-322 upper, 902-323 lower, 902-324 defrost, 902-325 recirc). Strongly recommended over plastic OEM doors, as they resist warping and actuator stress.

### 2. Heating and Cooling Cores
These are accessed during dash/HVAC housing removal, so replace them proactively to avoid coolant leaks (heater core) or poor A/C performance (evaporator).

- Heater Core: 1 unit (e.g., Mopar 68004228AB or Spectra Premium 99330). Aluminum construction for better heat transfer and corrosion resistance.
- A/C Evaporator Core: 1 unit (e.g., Four Seasons 54864 or UAC EV 939657PFC). Includes gaskets; flush the system before installation to remove debris.

### 3. A/C System Components
Since you suspect the A/C is failing, refresh the entire system to prevent compressor damage from contaminants. This model uses an orifice tube system (not expansion valve).

- A/C Compressor: 1 unit (e.g., UAC CO 10900C or Mopar equivalent; includes clutch). New, not remanufactured, to ensure reliability; pre-oiled for your 4.7L engine.
- A/C Condenser: 1 unit (e.g., OSC 4740 or Lynol equivalent). Parallel flow design for better cooling.
- Accumulator/Receiver-Drier: 1 unit (e.g., UAC RD 10032C). Essential to replace whenever the system is opened to remove moisture.
- Orifice Tube (Liquid Line with Orifice): 1 unit (e.g., Four Seasons 38623). Located in the liquid line; replace to ensure proper refrigerant flow.
- A/C Hose Assembly/Manifold: 1 set (e.g., UAC HA 11179C suction/discharge lines). Includes high/low pressure hoses; inspect for cracks and replace if worn.

### 4. Electrical and Airflow Components
These can fail over time and are easy to replace while the dash is out.

- Blower Motor: 1 unit (e.g., Four Seasons 35109 or Mopar 5015861AA). Includes fan cage; replace if noisy or weak.
- Blower Motor Resistor: 1 unit (e.g., Dorman 973-027). Controls fan speeds; common failure causing intermittent operation.
- HVAC Control Module/Head Unit: 1 unit (if needed; e.g., Mopar equivalent). Only if your controls are erratic; test first.

### 5. Seals, Gaskets, and Consumables
These ensure no leaks post-reassembly; always replace when opening the system.

- O-Ring and Gasket Kit: 1 full kit (e.g., UAC RS 2621). Includes all seals for lines, compressor, evaporator, and condenser connections.
- HVAC Housing Gaskets/Foam Seals: 1 set (e.g., from HeaterTreater kit or Dorman equivalents). For sealing doors and housing.
- Refrigerant (R-134a): 2-3 cans (24-36 oz total; system capacity is about 28 oz). Use with UV dye for leak detection.
- PAG Oil (for Compressor): 8-10 oz (e.g., UAC RO 0900B; ND-8 type for this system). Add during compressor install.
- A/C System Flush Kit: 1 kit (e.g., FJC 2408). Solvent and tool to clean lines, condenser, and evaporator of old oil/debris.
- Coolant/Antifreeze: 1-2 gallons (e.g., Mopar OAT formula). For refilling after heater core replacement; mix 50/50 with distilled water.
- Cabin Air Filter: 1 unit (if equipped; e.g., WIX 24483). Located behind glove box; replace for better airflow.

### 6. Miscellaneous/Support Parts
These help with reassembly and prevent issues.

- Dash Panel Clips/Screws: 1 assortment kit (e.g., Dorman 45680). Plastic clips often break during removal.
- Steering Column Bolts/Nuts: 1 set (if reusing; torque to spec: 35 ft-lbs for column bolts).
- Vacuum Line Kit: 1 set (if lines are brittle; e.g., assorted rubber hoses).
- Thermal Paste/Grease: Small tube (for actuator gears if lubricating during install).

### Additional Notes for Success
- **Total Estimated Cost**: $800-1,500 (parts only; varies by brand/quality). Shop at sites like RockAuto, AutoZone, or Amazon for deals; cross-reference part numbers for your VIN.
- **Tools Needed (Not Parts, But Essential)**: Socket set (metric/imperial), trim removal tools, Dremel (for door kits if cutting access), A/C manifold gauge set, vacuum pump (for evacuating/recharging system), torque wrench, and scan tool (for actuator recalibration post-install).
- **Steps Overview**: Drain coolant and evacuate A/C refrigerant (professionally if no tools). Remove dash (about 20-30 bolts/clips; disconnect battery first). Drop steering column. Remove HVAC housing, replace cores/doors/actuators. Flush A/C lines. Reassemble, vacuum/test for leaks, recharge refrigerant, refill coolant. Expect 10-20 hours for a DIY job.
- **Warnings**: Handle refrigerant legally (EPA rules); wear safety gear. If unsure about dual vs. single zone, check your controls (separate driver/passenger temp knobs = dual). Test actuators before full teardown. If A/C issues persist post-rebuild, it could be electricalâ€”diagnose with a multimeter.

This should cover everything for a successful rebuild. If you provide more details (e.g., single vs. dual zone, specific symptoms), I can refine the list.
